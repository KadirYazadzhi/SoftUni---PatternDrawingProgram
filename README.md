# 🎨 C# Pattern Drawing Project

Welcome to the **C# Pattern Drawing Project**, a C# console application inspired by the task of creating twelve unique patterns. This project demonstrates programming skills with nested loops, user interaction, and pattern drawing in C#. 🎉

## 📜 **Project Description**

The project aims to replicate twelve distinct patterns commonly made with C#. Each pattern leverages loops and conditional statements to generate visual shapes based on user input.

### 🔥 **Features**

- **User Interaction**: Users can specify the number of rows or the size for each pattern.
- **Multiple Patterns**: Users can generate twelve different patterns with just one program run.
- **Improved Display**: Patterns are rendered clearly in the console for easy viewing and comparison.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **C# .NET 6**: Core logic for creating patterns and handling user input.
- **Visual Studio**: IDE used for developing and testing the application.

## 📚 **Project Structure**

1. **Pattern Generation**: 
   - Uses nested loops to control row and column structures.
   - Patterns include triangles, squares, pyramids, and more.
   - For spacing, spaces and tabs (`"\t"`) are strategically used.

2. **User Input for Patterns**:
   - Prompts users to enter row or size information for each pattern.
   - Output varies based on user-provided size or row numbers.

## 🚀 **How to Use**

1. Open the project in Visual Studio:
   - Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.

2. Run the application:
   - The program will prompt you to choose a pattern number (1 to 12).
   - After selecting, input the row or size information to generate the pattern.
   - View each pattern in the console, and repeat as desired.

3. **Run Patterns by Code**:
   - Each pattern is executed via specific methods, making it easy to manage and scale.

## 🛠 **Pattern Types**

The project includes twelve different patterns:

1. **Right-angled Triangle**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
     *
     **
     ***
     ****
     *****
     ```

2. **Square with Hollow Center**  
   - User specifies the square size.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
     *****
     *   *
     *   *
     *   *
     *****
     ```

3. **Diamond Shape**  
   - User specifies the height (number of rows).  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
       *
      ***
     *****
      ***
       *
     ```

4. **Left-angled Triangle**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 4:
     ```
     ****
     ***
     **
     *
     ```

5. **Hollow Square**  
   - User specifies the square size.  
   - Example for input of 6:
     ```
     ******
     *    *
     *    *
     *    *
     *    *
     ******
     ```

6. **Pyramid**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 4:
     ```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
     ```

7. **Right-angled Triangle (Numbers)**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
     1
     12
     123
     1234
     12345
     ```

8. **Inverted Pyramid**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
     *********
      *******
       *****
        ***
         *
     ```

9. **Diamond (Numbers)**  
   - User specifies the number of rows for the diamond’s top half.  
   - Example for input of 4:
    ```
       1
      121
     12321
    1234321
     12321
      121
       1
    ```

10. **Mirrored Right-angled Triangle**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
         *
        **
       ***
      ****
     *****
     ```

11. **Alternating Star-Dash Square**  
   - User specifies square size.  
   - Example for input of 5:
     ```
     *-*-*
     -*-*-
     *-*-*
     -*-*-
     *-*-*
     ```

12. **Hourglass Shape**  
   - User specifies number of rows.  
   - Example for input of 4:
     ```
     *-*-*
     -*-*-
     *-*-*
     -*-*-
     ```
